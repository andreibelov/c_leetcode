In the code, we use the following hashing mechanism:

```c
mult = (j + 1) * (j + 1) % 4007;
table1[i] += (grid[i][j] * mult) % 3967;
table2[i] += (grid[j][i] * mult) % 3967;
```

Explanation:

* Purpose of mult:
  - mult is a multiplier that is computed based on the position of the element in the row or column.
  - We calculate mult as (j + 1) * (j + 1) % 4007, where j is the index of the element in the row or column.
  - This is designed to give different weights to elements depending on their position, which helps to distinguish between permutations of the same elements.
* Why j + 1?:
  - j + 1 ensures that the index starts from 1 (instead of 0), so the first element of the row or column also contributes to the hash.
  - Without +1, the first element would always multiply by 0, which wouldn't contribute to the hash val.

* Why square (j + 1)?:
  - Squaring (j + 1) amplifies the difference between elements at different positions.
  - For instance, the difference between the first and second positions becomes more pronounced (1 vs. 4, 4 vs. 9, etc.).
  - This helps to ensure that rows or columns with the same elements but in different orders produce different hash values.

* Modulo Operation % 4007 and % 3967:
  - Modulo operations are used to prevent overflow when multiplying large numbers.
  - The choice of 4007 and 3967 (which are prime numbers) is likely to reduce the chances of hash collisions. Primes are often used in hashing to distribute hash values more uniformly.
  - Using different moduli for mult and the final hash val adds randomness and helps in spreading out the possible hash values.

* Why Use (grid[i][j] * mult) % 3967?:
  - The element grid[i][j] (or grid[j][i] for columns) is multiplied by mult to incorporate its val and position into the hash.
  - The result is then taken modulo 3967 to ensure the hash val doesn't grow too large and to keep the computation manageable.

Putting It All Together:

The goal of this custom hash function is to create a unique hash for each row and column by considering both the values of the elements and their positions. Here's how it works:

 * Differentiation by Position: By multiplying each element by a val that depends on its position (with the squared index), elements in different positions contribute differently to the hash. This reduces the chances that rows/columns with the same elements but different orders will produce the same hash.

 * Prime Moduli for Uniform Distribution: Using modulo operations with prime numbers reduces the likelihood of different rows or columns accidentally producing the same hash (collisions), as primes help distribute the results of hash functions more uniformly across the possible range of values.

 * Sum Over All Elements: By summing these weighted contributions for each element in the row/column, the final hash val should ideally be unique to that specific configuration of elements and their order.
